1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,480
Hi.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,270
In this video we are going to show you how

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,230
to install the tools required for this
class on your machine.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,200
This video is for people using the Linux
operating system.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,780
If you're on a different operating system,
check the Getting

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,820
Started section in the video lectures part
of the class website.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,140
Everything that we show in this video is
also

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,640
explained in text on the Tools Setup wiki
page

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,760
on the class website.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,630
So we go to the Tool Setup page, and we
see that

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,990
there are three things that we need to
install for our class.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,060
The first one is the JDK, the Java
Development Kit.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,200
Which is a runtime environment on which
Scala programs are executed.

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,390
The second one is SBT, a build tool for
Scala, which

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,070
you will also be using for submitting your
assignment solutions to Coursera.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,430
The third one is the Scala IDE for
Eclipse, which

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,410
is the IDE we are going to use in this
class.

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,510
Okay, so let's get started by installing
the JDK.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,020
In the section installing the JDK there

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,930
are three sub-sections for different
operating system.

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,180
In this video we are going to look at the
part related to Linux.

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,498
While recording this screen cast, I am on

23
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:28,080
an Ubuntu system, and therefore, these are
the instructions that apply to my system.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,660
If you are using a different Linux
distribution,

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,020
you will have to do the JDK installation
differently.

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,180
So one of the other things that we need to
do

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,370
is start the terminal, and install the
open JDK using apt-get.

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,620
To start the terminal I just click on Dash
Home in the window and I search

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,160
for terminal.
And I can launch Terminal.

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,400
Since we will be using the Terminal a lot
in this tutorial,

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,960
I will lock it to the Launcher and make it
available more quickly.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, so the comment to install Open

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,280
JDK on Ubuntu is the following sudu

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,630
apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk.

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,590
And you have to enter your password, and
then apt-get will ask you to confirm.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,139
And now it will download and install the
JDK.

37
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:31,920
Okay, once that apt-get has finished
installing the JDK, we

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,100
want to make sure that everything has been
set up correctly.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,360
We go back to the Tools Setup page, and we
gotta read the section

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,600
Verifying Your Setup.

41
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,150
So what you have to do is, start a new
terminal,

42
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,060
so it loads the existing one and start a
new one.

43
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,437
And then you have to type java-version.

44
00:02:53,437 --> 00:03:00,930
Now you should see the version number of
the JDK that you just installed.

45
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,710
Okay, since this worked fine we are
closing the

46
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,459
terminal window and moving on to the
second step.

47
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:08,820
The second

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,450
step is installing SBT.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,440
In order to install SBT, it has to be
downloaded from this URL.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,490
So we simply click the URL, we save the
file and

51
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,970
Firefox will send it to the Download
folder of my Home directory.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,700
So we go to the Home directory, Download
folder, and we see this SBT archive.

53
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,530
So, now we have to extract the archive.

54
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,918
One way to do this in Ubuntu

55
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:37,580
is right click on the file and just
selecting Extract Here.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,420
Okay.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,110
So the SBT folder that has now been
created contains

58
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,830
bin directory, which in fact, contains the
executable for SBT.

59
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,220
So since SBT is a program that we might
want to use in the

60
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,100
future, I'm going to move it to a
different location.

61
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:04,600
So I cut the SBT folder and in my Home
directory I create a new folder,

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,790
which is which I call Applications.

63
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,930
And I paste the SBT folder in there.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
Okay, so let's go back to the Tools Setup
instructions.

65
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,220
So we already unpacked the archive.

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,420
And now what we need to do is add in the
bin directory

67
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,480
of the SBT installation that we

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,490
just downloaded to the PATH environment
variable.

69
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,570
In order to do that, you have to open.

70
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,770
bashrc, which is in your Home directory in
a text editor.

71
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,670
The easiest way to open that file is to
open a terminal, and type

72
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,200
in gedit.
And then.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,081
bashrc .

74
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:55,690
This will open the Text Editor with the
bashrc file.

75
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,130
Now in order to add SBT to the path we go
back to the set of instructions wiki page,

76
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,820
and we copy that export command that we
need to add to the bashrc file.

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,450
We copy it and we go back to gedit, and we
scroll

78
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,300
down to the end of the file, and just
paste the command.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,340
Now, in fact, you have to update the path

80
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,769
your SBT directory, with the real path on
your system.

81
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,700
So, the place where I installed it is in
/home.

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,868
And then my username, luc,

83
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:41,540
and then /applications, in sbt/bin.

84
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,320
Okay, so I close the gedit text.
I save my changes.

85
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,920
And now I have to verify that the SBT has
been installed correctly.

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,100
In order to do that, I have to open a new
terminal window

87
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,760
because the changes to bashrc will not be
applied to existing terminal sessions.

88
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,660
So I close my terminal.
I open a new one.

89
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,770
And in order to test SBT I

90
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,970
type sbt -h.

91
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,370
As expected, I see a help message from
SBT, so everything is fine.

92
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,610
Okay, so now we close the terminal window,
and the last thing

93
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,300
that we need to do is installing the Scala
IDE for Eclipse.

94
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
The Scala IDE for Eclipse, with all the
plugins and settings that

95
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,340
we need for the course, can be downloaded
from the following URL.

96
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:46,559
So I open this page in a new tab.
And I scroll down to the download links.

97
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,380
Now you just have to select the

98
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,450
Eclipse distribution which matches your
operating system.

99
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,820
In my case, I'm on the Linux system with a
32 bits.

100
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,780
So I download this file and save it in the
downloads folder.

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay, once the download of the Scala IDE

102
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,970
has finished, I can close the Download
window.

103
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,920
Close the Download page for the IDE.

104
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,910
And open the Download folder in my Home
directory.

105
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,370
Next, we unpack the downloaded Scala IDE
package using

106
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,350
the same mechanism as we used before for
SBT.

107
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,880
So, we right click on the file, and we
select Extract Here.

108
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,990
Okay.

109
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,930
Again, since the Scala IDE is an
application that we will continue using

110
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,450
in the future, I right click on the new
Eclipse folder, select Cut,

111
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,380
then I go to my Home folder, and then to
Applications.

112
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,130
I right click and select Paste.

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,600
In order to start Eclipse, I simply open
the

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,984
Eclipse folder and double click on the
Eclipse execute.

115
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,730
When starting Eclipse, you always have to

116
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,410
define which workspace you are going to
use.

117
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,510
We recommend that you create one workspace

118
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,520
for this class, which you then can reuse
for all the assignments of the class.

119
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,340
Okay, I will do that right now.

120
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,730
So I click the Browse folder to go to my
file system, I go

121
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,050
to my Home folder, and the create a New
Folder, which I call progfunworkspace.

122
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,150
Okay, I select the folder, I click Okay,
and then I start Eclipse.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,890
Okay, so this is the Scala IDE.

124
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,910
In order to verify that everything is
setup

125
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,480
correctly, I go to the setup instructions
wiki page.

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,390
On the bottom of the page, there is a
tutorial

127
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,720
on how to create the Hello World program
in Eclipse.

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,010
So I glue this right now inside Eclipse.

129
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,810
In order to create a new project, you
select File, New,

130
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,490
Scala Project from the menu, and you give
the project a name.

131
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,340
HelloWorld, and you can finish.

132
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,100
Now, we will create the HelloWorld program
file.

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,480
So, you open the HelloWorld project.

134
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,550
We right click on the source folder, and
we select New >Scala Object.

135
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,860
You have to give the object a name, so
will use Hello.

136
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,840
And we will put the object into a package.

137
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,500
In this case, Package greeter.

138
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,330
Okay, now the source project for Hello
World can be again found on the wiki page.

139
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,390
So, we go back to the wiki page, and we
scroll down a bit

140
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,610
to find the source code of the Hello,
World application, we select the code.

141
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,710
Right click and copy.
We go back to Eclipse.

142
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,590
And, we paste the code.
Okay.

143
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,300
Now, when we save the file, you will
notice

144
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,319
that Eclipse already compiled the file.

145
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,990
Since this file defines an executable
application,

146
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,440
you can directly run it inside Eclipse.

147
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,012
The easiest way to do this is right
clicking on

148
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:26,830
the Hello.scala source file, selecting Run
As > Scala Application.

149
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,690
You will then see the output of the Hello
World program on the bottom of the screen.

150
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,510
Good.

151
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,540
So the last thing that we are going to
show you in this

152
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,390
video is a brand new feature that has been
implemented for the Scala IDE.

153
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,560
The feature is called the Scala worksheet,
and it

154
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,710
gives you a very interactive console to
work with Scala.

155
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,870
In order to create the Scala worksheet you
have to right click on a package, select

156
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,070
New, and then select Scala Worksheet.
You have to give the worksheet a name.

157
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,720
And click Finish.

158
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,710
Okay, I have to make this window a bit
bigger.

159
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,210
Okay.

160
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,530
Every expression that you type into a
worksheet will be evaluated on the fly.

161
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:19,350
In order to demonstrate that, we go back
to the Tools Setup instructions, we scroll

162
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,890
up to the end and we copy the statements
that are at the end of the screen.

163
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,570
We go back to Eclipse,

164
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,809
and, and we paste this code into the
worksheet.

165
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,300
Okay.

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,090
So once its safe to file, Eclipse will

167
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,800
immediately evaluate all the expressions
in the worksheet.

168
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,670
So what it we do here is we define a value
x to be 1.

169
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,225
We define a function increase, which
returns its argument increased by 1.

170
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,610
And we test increase by invoking it, and
we pass the value x into the function.

171
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,350
And you can see

172
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,660
that the result of passing x into increase
is the value 2.

173
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,170
Now you can easily go back in the
worksheet and change some definitions.

174
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:17,231
For instance, now we change x to be 5.
And once you save the file, the entire

175
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:24,017
worksheet is reloaded and re-evaluated,
and the resulting value now is 6.
