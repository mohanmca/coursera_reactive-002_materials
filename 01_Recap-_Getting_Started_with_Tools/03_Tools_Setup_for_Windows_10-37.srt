00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,480
Hi.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,580
In this video we are going to show you how
to

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,080
install all the required tools for our
class on your machine.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,190
This video is for Windows users.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,050
If you are on a different operating
system, check the

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,780
Getting Started section of the video
lectures on the class website.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,510
Everything that we show on this video is
also described

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,320
on the Wiki page Tools Setup on the class
website.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,980
So, we go to the Tools Setup page, and we

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,560
see there are three things that we need to
install.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,190
The first one is JDK, the Java Runtime

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,279
Environment, which is used to execute
Scala programs.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,520
The second one is SBP.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,030
A built tool for Scala projects, which in
this class,

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,750
you will also use to submit your
assignment solutions to Coursera.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,140
The third one is the Scala ID for Eclipse
and the Scala Worskheet.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,709
Which is the ID that we are going to use
during this class.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,910
So, let's get started with the JDK.

19
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,255
So, we checked the JDK section, and there
are three

20
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:12,070
sub-sections for each operating system so,
we go to Windows.

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,030
First of all, we need to download the

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,167
JDK installer from this URL from the
Oracle website.

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,370
And the first thing you need to do is
accept the license agreement.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,400
And then you can download the JDK
distribution for your architecture.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,860
In my case I am on X64 so, I will download
this file.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,950
Once the download has finished, you

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,950
just run the downloaded Execute Double
Installer.

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,840
You don't have to change any of the
pre-define settings.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,170
The default options are fine.

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,990
The installer will also ask you to install
the Java Runtime Environment.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,709
Again, you can just follow the default
options.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,310
Okay once you've finished you click Close,
and you close the Oracle websites.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,440
You don't need to register.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,010
To finish the JDK installation, you need
to add the bin directory

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,430
of the JDK that you just installed to the
path environment variable.

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,180
How to do this is described on this
website here.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,760
I will show you how to do these on Windows
7.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,110
You go to the Start menu > Control panel.

39
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,910
And in the search box, you type
Environment Variable.

40
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,330
And then, you get the, the option to edit
the system environment variable.

41
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,320
So, you click there.

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,900
And you click on the button Environment
Variables.

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,520
In the list of system variables, you
search

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,600
for the variable named Path, and you
double-click on it.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,290
To this list of directories, you will now
add the bin directory of the JDK.

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,970
So, you go to the Start menu > Computer >
Local Disk > Program Files > Java.

47
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,660
You go to the JDK bin directory, and by
clicking in the location bar we can

48
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,710
copy this path by right-clicking.

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:23,795
We go back to the System Variable window,
and we need to add the semi-colon

50
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:28,360
and paste with Ctrl+V, the bin directory
of the JDK.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,580
If any shut with OK, and closing all the
dialogs.

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,468
You can also close all of the Explorer
windows.

53
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:41,960
Okay, so, now to test

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,830
that the JDK installation is successful,
you have to open a Command Prompt.

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,730
The Command Prompt can be found in the
Start

56
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,680
menu either by typing ser, by searching
for Command Prompt.

57
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,590
Or we can just go

58
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,770
to Start > All Programs, and then
Accessories.

59
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,849
And you have the Command Prompt.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,720
So, to check the Java installation you
type Java dash version and

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,390
you should see the version number of the
JDK you just installed.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,090
The second step is installing SBT.

63
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,860
Again, we scroll down to the Window
section.

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,910
And as you can see we have to download SBT
from this URL.

65
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,010
So, we click here and we round it,
download it installer.

66
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,224
Again we can leave off all the default
options and just hit the Install.

67
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:42,904
Okay, once SBT is installed we will also
verify that everything is

68
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:49,850
correctly set up so, we go to Start, and
to the Command Prompt.

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,660
And to test SBT we have to type the
following command,

70
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,644
sbt sbt dash version.

71
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,870
And now SBT will download a few
dependencies and libraries.

72
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,720
But this will only happen the first time
you actually run SBT.

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,640
After that, it will start up much faster.

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,970
Okay, at the end, SBT will show you

75
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,240
it's version number, which is supposed to
be 0.12.0.

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,690
Okay, we can

77
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,790
exit the Command Prompt.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,420
Now, the last thing we need to do.
Is installing the Scala IDE for Eclipse.

79
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
The Scala IDE for Eclipse can be
downloaded from the following URL.

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,790
On this website you just scroll down to
the list of

81
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,800
downloads, and you select the package
according to your operating system.

82
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,990
Once the download has finished, we open
the downloads folder in the Explorer.

83
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,910
You right-click the archive and you select
Extract All.

84
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,940
I'm going to extract the Eclipse, the
Scala ID for Eclipse to my desktop.

85
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,670
Once that Windows has finished extracting
the Zip file, we

86
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,910
will close the Explorer windows and also
the IDE download site.

87
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,700
Now we have to start Eclipse.

88
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,510
So, for that we go to the Desktop, we open
the Eclipse folder.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,260
And we just run the Eclipse Executable.

90
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,070
Now, whenever you start Eclipse, you have
to tell it which workspace to use.

91
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,100
For our class, we recommend that you
create one single

92
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,130
workspace that you can then reuse over all
the assignments.

93
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,050
So, I'm will do that now.

94
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,360
I go to my Home folder.
And I make a new folder which I called

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,410
Coursera Workspace.
And I select that as my Eclipse workspace.

96
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay, so this is the Scala IDE for
Eclipse.

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,780
In order to test whether everything has
been

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,670
set up correctly, we go back to the Wiki

99
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,350
page and we create a small Hello World
project

100
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,640
in Eclipse according to steps described on
this page.

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,230
I will just do it in Eclipse right now.

102
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,240
So, I maximize the window.
I select File > New >Scala project

103
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,840
and I give it a name.
Hell, hello world.

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,810
'Kay.

105
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,500
So, in every Eclipse workspace you can
have multiple projects.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,330
Now in order to create hello world.
programming Scala.

107
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,070
We right-click on the Source folder.
Select New > Scala Object.

108
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,040
And we create the Scala object, which we
call Hello, for instance.

109
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,550
And we usually put Scala code into a
package.

110
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,600
So, we create package which is named
greet, greeter.

111
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay.

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,330
Now, the actual code for the Hello World
is given on the Tool Setup page.

113
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,370
So, we go back to the Tool Setup page, and
we scroll down to see the source

114
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,450
code and we just copy it and paste it
inside Eclipse.

115
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,490
Okay?

116
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,730
We save the file, and you see when you
save

117
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,739
the file Eclipse will immediately compile
the workspace, the entire project.

118
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,365
Okay once the file has been compiled, we
can run the Hello World program by

119
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,670
right-clicking on the Hello dot Scala
source

120
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,250
file, choosing Run As, and selecting Scala
Application.

121
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,060
You will see the output of the Hello World
program in the Eclipse console.

122
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,590
Okay, this installation of Eclipse also
come with a

123
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,110
brand new feature, which is called the
Scala worksheet.

124
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,720
Creating a Scala worksheet is easy, and

125
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,260
again, described on the Tools Setup Wiki
page.

126
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,300
You can read through the instructions
here.

127
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,050
I will just read right now in Eclipse.
So we right-click on the creator package.

128
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,664
We select New and we choose Scala
Worksheet.

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,630
We give the work sheet a name.

130
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,660
Okay?

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,540
This will give us a new Scala object

132
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,800
in which we can write new arbitrary Scala
expressions.

133
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
And those will be evaluated on the fly.

134
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,120
To get an example, we have some code on
the Tool Setup page

135
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,740
that we can just copy and paste into the
worksheet that we just created.

136
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,130
Okay.

137
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,960
And once you save the file, Eclipse will
evaluate

138
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,500
all the code that is in this worksheet
object.

139
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,780
So, you can see we define a value x to be
one.

140
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,220
We define an Increase function which
returns its argument increased by one.

141
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,616
And then to test it we just invoke the
increase function and

142
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:25,450
pass x into it, and you see that the
result is two.

143
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,480
You can change a definition, for instance.

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,380
Now we say x to be five, and once you save
the

145
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,180
file, the change will be immediately
reflected in the rest of the worksheet.
