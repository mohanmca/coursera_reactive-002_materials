00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,580
Hi.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,360
In this video we are going to show you how

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,540
to install the tools required for our
class on your machine.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,890
This video is for people using Mac OS X.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,290
If you're using a different operating
system, check the Getting

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,899
Started section on the Video Lectures part
of the class website.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,790
Everything that is shown in this video is
also explained in

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,830
text on the tool setup wiki page on the
class website.

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,290
So, let's have a look at this page.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,420
As you can see, there are three things
that you need

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,380
to install on your machine in order to
prepare for this class.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,710
The first one is JDK, the Java runtime

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,960
environment, which is used to execute
Scala programs.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,130
The second one is SBT, a built tool for
Scala,

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,430
which will also use to submit your
assignment solutions to Coursera.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,180
The third one is the Scala ID for Eclipse,
which is

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,479
the IDE that we are going to use in this
class.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,020
Okay.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,740
So let's get started by installing the
Java debug kit.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,890
Every section in this tutorial has three
sub sections.

21
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,150
one for each operating system.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,590
Since we are currently on Mac OS 10 we
will

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,300
look at how to install the JDK on Mac OS
X.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,540
In fact Mac OS X either comes

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,980
with Java preinstalled, or it will install
it automatically for you.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,970
To verify if you already have Java, you
have to open a terminal application.

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,280
So, if you open the finder, we go to

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,310
the Applications folder, and we open the
Utilities folder.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,869
In Utilities, there is the application
named Terminal.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,820
Since we will be using the Terminal a lot
in this class,

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,800
it makes sense to Drag it into your Dock.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,010
Okay, so we can close the Finder right
now.

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,880
Open a Terminal.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,000
And now we want to verify if we have Java
installed.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,920
In order to do that, you type Java minus
version into the terminal.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,200
On this version, I don't have Java
installed yet.

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,600
So I will get the window which tells me to
open Java, I actually need to install it.

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,719
So the only thing you need to do is click
the Install button.

39
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,370
Of course you have to agree to the licence
agreements.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Okay, so once the Java installation has
finished, we

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,250
just click OK and we run Java Linux
version again.

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,130
Now we see the version number of the Java
installation that has been installed.

43
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,770
Okay, so we close this terminal window and
we

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,090
move onto the second word that we need to
install.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,870
The second tool that we need to install is
SBT.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,290
In order to install SBT on your system,
you can either use

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,439
home brew package match or, or you can do
a manual installation.

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,550
In this video I will do a manual
installation.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,140
So we download SBT from this url.

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,750
Once the download has finished we now
begin to find it

51
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,495
in the finder and we double click it to
extract SBT.

52
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,880
Okay so since SBT is an application that
we will reuse

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,320
in the future we will move it to a
different location.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
So I open it and you find a window.

55
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,905
And in my home folder I create the sub
directory named applications.

56
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:38,240
[SOUND]

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,500
Now I take the extracted SBT folder, and

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,990
I move it to my newly-created Applications
folder.

59
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,110
Inside the SBT folder you have a big

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,830
subdirectory which contains the executable
files for SBT.

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,770
So let's close the finder windows and go
back to the tutorial.

62
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,290
So we downloaded SBT, we unpacked the
archive.

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,530
And moved it to

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,610
the Applications folder.

65
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,500
And what we need to do last is add in

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,360
the bin directory of SBT to the path
environment variable.

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,350
In order to do that you have to open the
file.

68
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,470
bash on your score profile which is
located in your home directory.

69
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,570
If the file doesn't exist yet, you will
have to create it.

70
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,590
Okay, so let's open a new terminal window.

71
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,730
And let's check

72
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,410
if the batch profile file already exists.
So we type ls.

73
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:40,690
bash_profile .
In my case, the file does not exist yet.

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,160
But it might very well be that you already
have it.

75
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,670
So, in order to create or edit the file,
we can use

76
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,900
the nano text editor, which is a very
simple common line text editor.

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,312
We type nano.

78
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:57,710
bash_profile and hit enter.

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,190
So now we need to add one Export command
to this batch profile file.

80
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,060
We go back to the setup instructions.

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,030
We copy the Export command, right click
Copy and go back to the terminal.

82
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,140
And paste it using right-click Paste.
Now in fact, we have to change

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,584
the path of our SBT installation to match
the path where we actually extracted SBT.

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:36,086
In that case, this was /users/uc, my
username, /applications And then SBT bit.

85
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,894
Now we can exit the nano text editor using
control-x

86
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:47,306
and we will save the changes to the file
by control

87
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:52,130
with y and hitting enter for the file
name.

88
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,980
Okay, now we need to verify if SBT has
been installed correctly.

89
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,850
We close the terminal window and we go
back to the instructions.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,040
In order to verify the SBT installation we
have to start

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,560
a new terminal window and we have to type
SBT minus H.

92
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,620
If the installation was successful, then
you will

93
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,009
see the SBT help message appear on the
screen.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,060
Now you have to find the version of

95
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,350
the Scala IDE which matches your operating
system.

96
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,535
In my case, I am on a 64 bit Mac OSX so I
click this link.

97
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:53,550
[SOUND]

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,080
Once the download of the Scala IDE has
finished.

99
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,330
We open the download folder in the Finder.

100
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,330
We unpack the Scala IDE by simply
double-clicking the file.

101
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,350
Since the Scala IDE is an application that
we will resue

102
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,880
in the future, we will also move it to our
Applications folder.

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,410
So I open a new window.

104
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,930
I go up to my applications folder, and I
move the eclipse folder into my

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,260
applications.
In order to open the Scala ID you

106
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,930
simply go into the eclipse folder and you
double click the eclipse file.

107
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,260
When starting up Eclipse, you have to
define which work space you want to use.

108
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,010
We recommend that you create one work
space, which you

109
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,390
can then reuse for all the assignments of
our class.

110
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,070
I will do this now by clicking the Browse
button and going to my Home folder.

111
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,758
Okay, so now here I will create the new
older

112
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:10,570
named prog fun word space.
I will select the folder and click Open.

113
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,810
By clicking OK eclipse will start up using
that new work space.

114
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,619
OK in order to test the Scala ID we go
back to the tool set of instructions page.

115
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,030
We can close the download page.

116
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,260
And the tool setup page explains you to

117
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,450
create the simple hello world project in
Scala IDE.

118
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,400
I will show you how to do this now.

119
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,939
So you go to eclipse and in the menu you
select File > New > Scala Project.

120
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,310
You give the project a name, for instance,
Hello World.

121
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,990
Okay, in order to enter the source code
for the

122
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,217
Hello World application We have to create
a new scala object.

123
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,752
So we open the project, and we right click

124
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:10,471
on the source folder, and select New >
Scala Object.

125
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,742
We give the object a name.

126
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,592
In this case, hello.

127
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:20,150
And we define in which package the object
is defined.

128
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,980
So we put here the package greeter.
We confirm by clicking finish.

129
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,890
Okay, now the source code for the hello
word

130
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,650
application can be found under tools, set
up instructions.

131
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,690
So we go back to the wiki page and we

132
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,019
scroll down to find the source code that
we need.

133
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,510
We select it, copy it.
Go back to Eclipse.

134
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,220
And just paste

135
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,030
it into the file.

136
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,290
We save the file, and you can notice that
once you

137
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,600
save a file, Eclipse will automatically
compile the entire project for you.

138
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,794
In order to execute the Hello World
appllication You simply have to

139
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:04,690
right-click on the hello.scala source
file,

140
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,520
select Run As, and select Scala
Application.

141
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,730
You will see the output of the Hello World
program in the e, in the Eclipse console.

142
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,070
The last feature that we are going to show

143
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,029
you, is a brand new feature named the
Scala Worksheet.

144
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,310
In the Scala worksheet, you can type
arbitrary Scala expressions.

145
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,120
And see them evaluated on the fly.

146
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,590
It's a great tool to learn and explore
Scala.

147
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,880
In order to create the worksheet, we
right-click

148
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,870
on the Create Package, we select New Scala
worksheet.

149
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,490
You have to give the worksheet a name, and
click finish to create it.

150
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,340
Okay, I will increase the size of this
window

151
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,265
in order to see all the, all the words.

152
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,920
[NOISE]

153
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,080
Now to try out the worksheet we have
prepared some instructions

154
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,640
for you that you can paste in to this
newly created object.

155
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,570
So if you go back to the set up
instructions,

156
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,930
and scroll down to the bottom of the page,
you

157
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,430
will see a few lines of code that you can

158
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,825
copy and paste back in this freshly
created scholar worksheet.

159
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:24,420
[NOISE]

160
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,450
Okay.

161
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,710
Once you save the file, eclipse will

162
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,350
automatically evaluate all the lines that
are part

163
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,182
of the worksheet, and show the result of
the evaluation on the right hand side.

164
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:40,932
In this example, we assign the number one
to the value x.

165
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:47,482
We define a function increase, which
returns its argument decrease by one.

166
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,507
And we test increase by

167
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:53,432
invoking it and passing x into the
function.

168
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:57,195
You can see that an increase of x returns
two.

169
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,030
Now, if you go back in the worksheet and

170
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,140
change the definition of x, for instance,
to be 5.

171
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,100
As soon as we save the file, the whole
buffer will be reevaluated.

172
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:17,786
And you can see that the result of the
invocation of increase is now 6.
