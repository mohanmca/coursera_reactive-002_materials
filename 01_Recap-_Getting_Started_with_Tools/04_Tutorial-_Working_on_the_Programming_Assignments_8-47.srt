00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,730
Hi.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,940
In this video we are going to show you how
to work on the programming assignments.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,450
We show you how to download them, how to
import them into Eclipse,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,194
how to test your code and how to submit
your solutions using SBT.

5
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,630
Okay, so lets get started by going to the
assignments page.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,510
And we open the Getting Started section,
and

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,760
we go to the instructions of the example
assignment.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,790
So the first thing you need to do is
installing all the required tools.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,570
How to do this is explained on the Tools
Setup page.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,750
I will quickly show it to you.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,250
And for every operating system, you can
also have screen

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,370
task which also shows you how to setup the
tools.

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,640
Since I already installed everything on
this

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,120
machine, I just go right into the
assignment.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,100
So, the first thing you need to do is
download the assignment archive.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,440
Okay.
We open that file in the Explorer.

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,554
And now I will extract the assignment
archive into my home directory.

18
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:11,850
So I right click, select Extract All, and
I will create a new

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,459
directory in my Home folder, which I will
use for the programming assignments.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:25,110
So I go to my Home directory, I create a
new folder, I call it progfun assignment,

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,750
and I click Extract.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,390
So I close the Explorer window and go back
to the assignment.

23
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,850
And the first thing we're going to do is

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,960
starting Scala REPL inside the project
that we just created.

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,960
How you can do this is explained on the
SBT tutorial website.

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,490
So I open the SBT tutorial.

27
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,770
And they follow the instructions which are
on this page.

28
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,971
So, I open a CommandPrompt, I go to the

29
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:01,560
directory of my assignments over I go see
the

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,410
progfun assignments and then here I go see
the example since

31
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,020
I am working on the example assignment and
I start SBT.

32
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,800
Okay, once the SBT console has loaded you
can,

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,110
from SBT start, the Scala REPL using the
console command.

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,890
So you type console, hit enter, and then
SBT will start the Scala REPL.

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,640
Now we are

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,230
in the Scala interpreter.

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,380
Here we can type arbitrary Scala
expression

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,070
and they will be evaluated on the fly.

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,870
For example, you can say println, and
parse the string,

40
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,740
and the print align comment will be
evaluated.

41
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,820
That is how we recommend that you start
the Scala interpreter during this lesson.

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,590
In order to close the Scala interpreter
and get

43
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,490
back to the SBT console, you have to type
Ctrl+D.

44
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,020
You will not see anything on the screen
except that this Scala interpreter exists.

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,030
Now we are back in the SBT shell.

46
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,190
Okay so now we will go back to the
assignment.

47
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,200
We close the SBT tutorial and we move down
to

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,300
the next step, which is opening the
project in Eclipse.

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,650
So, you start up Eclipse.

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,820
In my case, I have a shortcut on my
desktop.

51
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,840
And once you start Eclipse you have to
choose a workspace to work with.

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,090
If you already created a workspace for our
class, then you can just use that.

53
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,860
Otherwise you just create a new folder in
your home directory and use that.

54
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,275
So my workspace is a progfun workspace in
my home directory.

55
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:40,260
[SOUND]

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,850
Okay, inside Eclipse you can just import a

57
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,720
project that you extracted in your home
directory.

58
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,860
You do this by going to File, Import and

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,920
in the General section you select Existing
Project into Workspace.

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
You go Next and you browse through

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,440
the directory where you unpacked the
assignment.

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,160
So we go to progfun assignments and we

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,780
accept the example folder, which is the
project directory.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,430
Okay, we click finish.

65
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,660
And now we already have the source code
imported into Eclipse.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,540
So we open up the project, and in the

67
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,630
source folder, source main Scala, in the
package example

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,530
you see the file Lists.scala, which is the
file

69
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,130
that you actually have to work on during
this assignment.

70
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,150
Okay, so let's go back to the
instructions.

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,430
So, the next assignment that you have

72
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,920
to do is actually implementing the
assignment.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,650
If you actually look at the code, there
are

74
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,940
two functions that need to be implemented,
sum and max.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,400
Both functions are currently defined with
a triple

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,950
question mark, which means they are not
yet implemented.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,100
Okay, in this case, I will not do a real
implementation, but just return 0

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,700
for both of them which is obviously wrong,
but I don't want to spoil the solution.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,720
So let's go back to the assignment.

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,320
The next step is running your code.
There are two ways to run your code.

81
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,060
You can start the Scala REPL and use the
functions

82
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,180
that you just implemented in Eclipse in
the Scala REPL.

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,990
For that, we go to the command prompt,

84
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,680
we go back to the Scala REPL by typing
console.

85
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,180
And

86
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,050
now we have another look at the source
code.

87
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,100
So the two functions, that we just
implemented are defined

88
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,730
in our object list, which in fact lives in
package example.

89
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,965
So if you want to use the functions, we
have to either use the full name,

90
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:41,922
example.list.sum, or we can also import
the members of this object into the REPL.

91
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:48,690
In order to import it, we just type,
import example.Lists._,

92
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,650
which means everything.

93
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,280
And now the two functions that we defined
are available, so we can try them out.

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,920
For instance we can try the sum function
and, type sum of list of 1, 2 and 3.

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,610
And we get 0 because obviously our
implementation is not correct.

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,420
Okay.

97
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,490
Another way to run your code is using a
main object.

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,730
This is explained on the, on the
assignment page and I will not go

99
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,760
into details right now.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,880
The next part of the assignment is writing
tests.

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,050
So if you go to eclipse, you see that

102
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,760
there is a second source folder which is
named src/test/scala.

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,940
And this directory contains tests for our
code.

104
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,740
In fact, we already give you a test suite
for the lists object.

105
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,060
If you open it up you will see that the
lists test suite is a

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,780
whole tutorial on how to use Scala test,
the tool that we are using for testing.

107
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,420
It is really important that you work
through this tutorial because

108
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,899
we will be using testing a lot during all
of our class.

109
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,130
Okay, let's go back to the assignment.

110
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,690
After your finished testing and everything
is correct you can submit your solution.

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,350
In order to do that you have to go back to
SBT.

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,090
Okay?

113
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,490
So we open the CommandPrompt and we see,
in fact, we are

114
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,940
still in the Scala shell right now, so we
type Ctrl+D, and

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,990
we are back in the SBT shell, okay?

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,740
Now, to submit your solution, the SBT

117
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,730
shell defines a command, which is named
Submit.

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,240
The Submit command takes two arguments.

119
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,250
The first one is your email address.

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,360
The one that you used for registering on
Coursera.

121
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,420
The second argument to the submit command
is your submission password.

122
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,160
The submission password is not the
password that you use for logging in.

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,720
Instead the submission password can be
obtained at the course website.

124
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,800
So we go to the course website and we
scroll

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,880
up, and you have to go to the assignments
page.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,810
On top of the assignment page you see your
username and your submission password.

127
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,800
Again, this is not

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,840
your login password.

129
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,030
So we copy the submission password, we go
back to the shell, and we paste it.

130
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:09,020
And now if you type Enter, your solution
will be packed and uploaded to Coursera.

131
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,270
Finally, in order to see your grade.

132
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,880
Again, you go to the Coursera website.
You go the assignment.

133
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,790
And you look at the assignment that you've
just submitted.

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,950
I already have a score, because I
submitted before.

135
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,350
Notice that you can submit the same
assignment as often as you like.

136
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,660
So, if I click on the score.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,640
I will see the feedback that I received
for earlier submissions that I did.

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,890
So all the feedback below is for
submissions that I did a few days ago.

139
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,360
But you can also see that there is a new
submission,

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,830
which I did just right now, which has not
yet been graded.

141
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,380
Usually grading takes between five and ten
minutes.
